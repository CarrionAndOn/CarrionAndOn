# Hi! I mainly make BONELAB code mods with C#, but I do some other stuff with Python and HTML too.

# Here's some stuff I did with C#:

## [Little Buddy](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/CarrionAndOn/LittleBuddy/)
### Clones the player's rigmanager, cleans it up to prevent issues, just so you can have a little friend :)

## [The Library Electric](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/CarrionAndOn/TheLibraryElectric/)
### A collection of monobehaviours that do stuff that Bonelab's SDK can't do itself, such as freezing every rigidbody in the scene while not touching existing kinematic RBs and the player.

## [Fantasy Coliseum](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/CarrionAndOn/FantasyColiseum/)
### Unlocks the enemy limit in Fantasy Arena, so you can have more than 10 enemies in the arena. Way more fun.

## [Good Ol Days](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/CarrionAndOn/GoodOlDays/)
### Restores the warning messages from BONEWORKS modding.
