# Hi! I mainly make BONELAB code mods with C#, but I do some other stuff with Python and HTML too.

# Here's some stuff I did with C#:

## ![The Library Electric](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/CarrionAndOn/TheLibraryElectric/)
### A collection of monobehaviours that do stuff that Bonelab's SDK can't do itself, such as freezing every rigidbody in the scene while not touching existing kinematic RBs and the player.
